# ECIS Content & SEO Standards

## Brand Voice & Tone
**Voice:** Confident, precise, helpful, authoritative yet approachable
**Tone Pillars:**
- **Authoritative:** "We secure over 200 properties across the region"
- **Precise:** Specific metrics, clear processes, definitive statements
- **Trustworthy:** Professional credentials, transparent communication
- **Helpful:** Solution-focused, actionable guidance

### Voice Examples
✅ **Good:** "Our certified officers respond within 3 minutes of alarm activation"
❌ **Avoid:** "We try to get there pretty quickly when something happens"

✅ **Good:** "Request a comprehensive security assessment"
❌ **Avoid:** "Get more info about our stuff"

## Microcopy & UI Text

### Button Text (Action-Oriented)
```vue
<!-- Use verbs that indicate specific actions -->
<button>Request Patrol Coverage</button>      <!-- Not "Learn More" -->
<button>Schedule Site Assessment</button>     <!-- Not "Contact Us" -->
<button>Book Training Session</button>        <!-- Not "Get Started" -->
<button>Download Incident Report</button>     <!-- Not "Click Here" -->
<button>Speak with Security Expert</button>   <!-- Not "Chat Now" -->
```

### Form Labels & Help Text
```vue
<template>
  <!-- Clear, specific labels -->
  <label for="property-type">Property Type</label>
  <select id="property-type">
    <option value="residential">Residential Community</option>
    <option value="commercial">Commercial Property</option>
    <option value="hoa">HOA/Neighborhood</option>
    <option value="construction">Construction Site</option>
  </select>
  
  <!-- Helpful, reassuring text -->
  <p class="help-text">
    This helps us recommend the right security solution for your needs. 
    All information is confidential.
  </p>
  
  <!-- Error messages that don't blame the user -->
  <p class="error" v-if="error">
    Please select your property type to continue.
  </p>
</template>
```

### Status Messages
```vue
<!-- Success messages -->
<div class="success-message">
  ✅ "Your security assessment has been scheduled for tomorrow at 2 PM"
  ✅ "Application submitted successfully. We'll contact you within 24 hours"
</div>

<!-- Error messages (never blame user) -->
<div class="error-message">
  ❌ "You didn't fill out the required fields" 
  ✅ "Please complete all required fields to submit your request"
  
  ❌ "Invalid phone number"
  ✅ "Please enter a valid phone number (e.g., 555-123-4567)"
</div>

<!-- Loading states -->
<div class="loading-message">
  ✅ "Checking officer availability..."
  ✅ "Securing your session..."
  ✅ "Generating your report..."
</div>
```

## Page Content Structure

### Headlines & Subheadlines
```vue
<template>
  <!-- H1: Clear value proposition -->
  <h1>Professional Security Services That Protect What Matters Most</h1>
  
  <!-- Supporting headline: Specific benefits -->
  <p class="subheadline">
    24/7 patrol coverage, rapid emergency response, and comprehensive 
    security solutions for residential communities and commercial properties.
  </p>
  
  <!-- H2: Problem/solution focused -->
  <h2>Stop Security Incidents Before They Impact Your Property</h2>
  
  <!-- H3: Specific features/services -->
  <h3>Advanced CCTV Monitoring & Real-Time Alerts</h3>
</template>
```

### Service Descriptions
Follow Problem → Solution → Outcome structure:
```markdown
**Problem:** "Property crimes in residential communities increased 15% last year"
**Solution:** "Our certified patrol officers provide visible deterrence with scheduled and random patrols"
**Outcome:** "Properties under our protection see 87% fewer security incidents"
```

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Hierarchy
1. **Primary CTA:** Main conversion goal (Request Quote, Schedule Assessment)
2. **Secondary CTA:** Lower commitment (Learn More, Download Guide)
3. **Tertiary CTA:** Social proof (Read Case Studies, View Testimonials)

```vue
<template>
  <div class="cta-section">
    <!-- Primary CTA -->
    <button class="btn btn--primary btn--large">
      Get Your Free Security Assessment
    </button>
    
    <!-- Secondary CTA -->
    <button class="btn btn--secondary">
      Download Security Checklist
    </button>
    
    <!-- Tertiary CTA -->
    <a href="/case-studies" class="link-tertiary">
      See How We Protected Similar Properties →
    </a>
  </div>
</template>
```

## SEO Implementation

  ogImage: '/images/ecis-og-image.jpg',
  ogType: 'website',
  twitterCard: 'summary_large_image'
})
</script>

<template>
  <!-- Page-specific structured data -->

  }
  </script>
</template>
```

### URL Structure
```
✅ /services/security-patrol
✅ /services/hoa-security  
✅ /training/security-officer-certification
✅ /case-studies/residential-community-protection

❌ /page1
❌ /services?id=123
❌ /training/course-abc-xyz
```

### Content Hierarchy (H1-H6)
```vue
<template>
  <!-- One H1 per page -->
  <h1>{{ pageTitle }}</h1>
  
  <!-- H2 for main sections -->
  <section>
    <h2>Our Security Services</h2>
    
    <!-- H3 for subsections -->
    <article>
      <h3>24/7 Patrol Coverage</h3>
      
      <!-- H4 for features/details -->
      <div>
        <h4>Visible Deterrence</h4>
        <h4>Emergency Response</h4>
      </div>
    </article>
  </section>
</template>
```

## Readability Guidelines

### Sentence & Paragraph Length
- **Sentences:** 15-20 words average, 25 words maximum
- **Paragraphs:** 2-3 sentences, 50-75 words
- **Reading level:** Grade 8-10 (use tools like Hemingway Editor)

### Content Formatting
```vue
<template>
  <!-- Use bullet points for features -->
  <ul>
    <li>✓ 3-minute average response time</li>
    <li>✓ GPS-tracked patrol vehicles</li>
    <li>✓ Real-time incident reporting</li>
  </ul>
  
  <!-- Use numbers and statistics -->
  <div class="stats-grid">
    <div class="stat">
      <span class="stat-number">15+</span>
      <span class="stat-label">Years Experience</span>
    </div>
    <div class="stat">
      <span class="stat-number">200+</span>
      <span class="stat-label">Properties Protected</span>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Emphasize key points -->
  <p>
    Our security officers are <strong>licensed and bonded</strong> with 
    <em>continuous training</em> in the latest security protocols.
  </p>
</template>
```

### Industry-Specific Terminology
**Use these terms consistently:**
- "Security patrol" (not "guard service")
- "Property protection" (not "watching stuff")
- "Incident response" (not "emergency handling")
- "Certified officers" (not "security guards")
- "Site assessment" (not "property walkthrough")

## Legal & Compliance Content
Always include:
```vue
<template>
  <!-- Licensing information -->
  <p class="legal-notice">
    Licensed by the State Security Board (License #12345). 
    Fully insured and bonded for your protection.
  </p>
  
  <!-- Privacy/confidentiality -->
  <p class="privacy-statement">
    All client information and security assessments are strictly confidential 
    and protected under attorney-client privilege where applicable.
  </p>
  
  <!-- Equal opportunity -->
  <p class="eeo-statement">
    ECIS Solutions is an Equal Opportunity Employer committed to diversity 
    and inclusion in our workforce.
  </p>
</template>
```
